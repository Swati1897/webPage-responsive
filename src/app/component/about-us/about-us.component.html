          <p>As we could see, the BreakpointObserver service of the Angular Cdk makes it super simple to make our
             Angular components responsive, without having to write a single media query.

            Again, not that there is anything fundamentally wrong with adding media queries directly to your 
            components CSS, it's just that I find that this approach is easier to read and maintain in the long term.
            
            For example, if you want to search for all the specific styles in your application that target a phone
             in portrait mode, you can just search for is-phone-portrait,
             as opposed to searching for a media query where it's easy to miss certain styles due to formatting, 
             spacing, indenting, etc.
            
            I also find that if the responsive CSS of each component is written this way, its just easier to read and 
            understand it, which helps the codebase remain maintainable over time.
            
            I hope that you have enjoyed this post, if you would like to learn a lot more about Angular Material,
             we recommend checking the Angular Material In Depth course, where responsive design is covered in detail.
